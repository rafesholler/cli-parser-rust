# CLI_Parser
A crate for parsing commands and arguemnts passed to the console.
 
This can parse commands with various arguments. It currently only supports option arguments (or args beginning with a "-"), but an update for regular params and argument rules (like ordering) will be coming soon.

## Installation
There is currently no way to install this package. Once it is published on [crates.io] it will be available for installation.
